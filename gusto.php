            When I joined Gusto, then ZenPayroll as the fifth member of the design team, I worked as generalist moving from in-product illustrations, to office and enviornment signage, to designing and developing web pages. During this time, I worked within a pre-existing brand guideline called Garden Styles.

            In September of 2015, ZenPayroll went through a radical transformation of it’s identity. We announced a new name, new visual indentity, logo, and a health benefits product. The company worked with two agencies to develop the messaging platform and logo. While the agencies provided us with a great starting point, we felt that the in-house design team, which at that point had grown to 10 designers, had a deeper understanding of the Gusto brand and we decided to take the redesign in-house. I worked closely with the CEO, Head of Design, and many other indivduals in the company to build out our corporate website (oh yeah, and we had about 2 weeks o do it).

            With this new product offering and young brand, we we’re also attracting new and larger customer types.

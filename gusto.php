            Gusto is a fully integrated HR, payroll, and benefits company that supports small and mid-sized companies across the United States. I joined Gusto when the company was an 80 person team called ZenPayroll, offering a payroll tool and watched it grow into a 340+ person company called Gusto offering a full HR suite of features.

            I played an integral part of ZenPayroll marketing collateral, customer acquisition expirements, and working on interactive pieces as apart of the brand team.

            When I joined Gusto, then ZenPayroll as the fifth member of the design team, I worked as generalist moving from in-product illustrations, to office and enviornment signage, to designing and developing web pages. During this time, I worked within a pre-existing brand guideline called Garden Styles.

            In September of 2015, ZenPayroll went through a radical transformation of it’s identity. We announced a new name, new visual indentity, logo, and a health benefits product. The company worked with two agencies to develop the messaging platform and logo. While the agencies provided us with a great starting point, we felt that the in-house design team, which at that point had grown to 10 designers, had a deeper understanding of the Gusto brand and we decided to take the redesign in-house. I worked closely with the CEO, Head of Design, and many other indivduals in the company to build out our corporate website (oh yeah, and we had about 2 weeks o do it).

            With this new product offering and young brand, we we’re also attracting new and larger customer types.

          <h4>Gusto brand guide</h4>
          <p>
            As apart of the rebrand from ZenPayroll to Gusto in September 2015, I was an integral part of establishing the original style guide and then again in March 2016 creating an fine-tuned version, as shown above. This included establishing typography, typographic styles, colors, and a UI library for print and digital. We also converted all styles into the code database.

            Gusto  is an integrated payroll, benefits, and HR software for small and mid-sized businesses. The company was founded in 2011 as ZenPayroll and rebranded to Gusto in September of 2015. Gusto serves over 40,000 companies nationwide and has offices in San Francisco and Denver.

          <p>
            I joined Gusto &mdash; then ZenPayroll,  as the fifth member of the design team. I had the great opportunity to work with several agencies and the in-house team, shaping ZenPayroll’s rebrand to Gusto and it's new brand identity. In addition I worked on Gusto's growth team focusing on growing new channels for customer acquisition, and on the Brand design team &mdash; building brand awareness through marketing campaigns.

          <p class='text-strong'>Ready, set, rebrand!</p>
          <p>In September of 2015, ZenPayroll went through a radical transformation. We changed our name to Gusto and underwent new branding, logo, and unveiled a health benefits product. The company worked with two agencies to develop the messaging platform and logo. The agencies laid the groundwork of the new brand and was a huge source of inspiration for the team. From that point, the in-house design team spearheaded the redesign &mdash; launching our new website, logo, and brand colors. I was deeply involved in the rebranding, working closely with Nelson Cash, the staff team, and the Head of Design.</p>
          <p class='text-strong'>Gusto brand guidelines</p>
          <p>
            As apart of ZenPayroll's rebrand to Gusto, the company needed to establish new brand guidelines for print, web, and product. The design team worked collaboratively to establish a system that was scalable, flexible, and distinct. I was an integral part of the teams that established our colors and typography. The style guide was sent out for internal use and to external vendors, as well as built out by myself and the team in our code database.

          <p>
            In September of 2016, the Gusto Brand team launched a brand awareness campaign. The original campaign concept was pitched by myself and two colleagues. It originated from insights we gleamed from a focus group session conducted with HR admins in California and New Jersey. From the sessions, a common thread among the HR admins was the immense breadth of their role, which included recruiting, onboarding, payroll and office management to name a few. In short &mdash; HR admins do everything. We felt that Kristen Schaal was the perfect person to embody this role because of her quirky charm and cheery personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based off this concept, the team wrote the original script of the 'So many Zoes' video and collaborated with Erich &amp; Kallman and Biscuit Production to develop three other short videos of the series. I creative directed the photo shoot with Kristen Schaal, choosing the props, wardrobe, and poses for the photos that would be featured on our corporate website, billboards and other campaign collateral.
          </p>
          <p>
            The commercials resonated with our audience, obtaining over 1,400,000 views and was awarded

            <p>
              These projects were typically run by a small team consisting of myself, a product marketing manager, copywriter, and illustrator. I worked closely with stake-holders to fully understand the context and goals of each page. I designed within the constraints of our brand guideline, and often with customer acquisition in mind. The designs were presented in our team wide critique and reviewed by members of staff at important milestones.

          <p class='text-strong'>A data-driven approach to designing for acquisition</p>
          <p>
            I lead design on the Growth team at Gusto for four quarters between 2015 - 2016. The team's mission was to acquire new customers by running AB tests, conducting user-research and other acquisition experiments. I worked closely in a small agile team of engineers and product managers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team used a data-driven approach and designed within in the constraints of conversion optimization. Working on this team sharpened my instincts for designing for conversion and I found it immensely gratifying to have such a measurable impact on the company by making a quantifiable improvements on our conversion rate overtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The AB test featured was a project that I initiated, designed, and developed. The mission was to increase the conversion rate our default paid landing page template. I designed the page using acquisition best practices including &mdash; front-loading important information above the fold, creating a clear hierarchy of information, visually distinguishing the form, and providing areas of social proof including press logos, secure check-out call-out, and customer testimonials. This page out-performed our incumbent landing page increasing the page's conversion rate from 3.2% to 9% over the course of 6 months.

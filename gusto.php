            I joined Gusto — then ZenPayroll,  as the fifth member of the design team. At that time, I was a generalist working on everything from in-product illustrations, to office and environment signage, to designing and developing web pages. During this time, I worked within a pre-existing brand guideline called Garden Styles.

          <p class='text-strong'>Rebrand</p>            
          <p>
            In September of 2015, ZenPayroll went through a radical transformation. We changed our name to Gusto and underwent new branding, logo, and unveiled a health benefits product. The company worked with two agencies to develop the messaging platform and logo. The agencies laid the groundwork of the new brand and was a huge source of inspiration for the team. From that point, the in-house design team spearheaded the redesign — launching our new website, logo, and brand colors. I was deeply involved in the rebranding, working closely with Nelson Cash, the staff team, and the Head of Design.

          <p>  
            For most of 2015 and 2016, I was the design lead on Gusto’s growth team. The team’s mission was to acquire larger customers by running AB tests, conducting user-research and other user experiments. I worked closely in a small agile team of engineers and product managers. The design team used a  data-driven approach and designed within in the constraints of conversion optimization. Working on this team sharpened my instincts for designing for conversion and I found it immensely gratifying to be able to produce such a large impact on the company by making a quantifiable impact on our conversion rate overtime.

            As Gusto is a relatively new name in the HR space, especially compared to the incumbents, it’s a great challenge and opportunity for the Brand Marketing team to shape our voice and brand. This sounded like a problem that I wanted to solve so I joined the Brand team at Gusto in 2016. I work closely with product marketing managers, copywriting, and visual designers on product releases, brand campaigns, and occasionally commercials :)

          <h4>Brand guidelines</h4>
          <p>
            As apart of the rebrand from ZenPayroll to Gusto in September 2015, I was an integral part of establishing the original style guide and then again in March 2016 creating an fine-tuned version, as shown above. This included establishing typography, typographic styles, colors, and a UI library for print and digital. We also converted all styles into the code database.
